Hello. I am **Mozhar Alhosni**. Welcome to my Digital Garden, in where I share the knowledge I harvest everyday.

I am an Offensive Cybersecurity Specialist. My passion is programming (been doing it for over 10 years) and web development and security. I specialize in `ASP.NET`, with a focus on `Web APIs` and `Blazor` web apps (`.NET 7` and `.NET 8`).

If you would like to contact me, email me over `mozharalhosni@gmail.com`.
