# arXiv

The [Cryptography and Security](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CR/recent) section of `arXiv` is top-notch to stay educated about state of the art cryptography and computer security research papers. 

nHowever, sometimes the papers published there are of poor quality (and even some seem to be generated by a GPT model). Therefore, the reader should take precautions and not trust everything stated in these research papers blindly.
